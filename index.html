                Hello, my name is Dallin and this is a little about me. I am 24
                and I have lived in Utah all my life. I have been married to my
                wife Christina for three years and we have a beautify daughter
                named Ella. I met my wife at a church activity and she has been
                crazy about me ever since.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am currenlty working a Tech Support job and I have enrolled in
                the Full Stack Bootcamp through the University of Utah to
                advance my career. I do have some experience with web
                development walking into this Bootcamp but I am always ready to
                learn more.
